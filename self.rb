  puts "When something's not working, I want to take thirty seconds to read the error message(s) and then talk about possible solutions before we try one. Sometimes I like to open up repl.it to sketch out a quick solution."
  
  puts "When we meet a goal, I love to take a quick 1-min mental break, chat, or just give a little cheer."
