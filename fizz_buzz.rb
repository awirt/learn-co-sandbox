#Goals: create a program that receives any number and
# prints "fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
# prints "buzz" if the number is divisible by 5
# prints "fizzbuzz" if the number is divisble by both 3 & 5

#Use modulus (%) to determine the remainder of any division expression
puts 12 % 3       #returns 0
puts 10 % 3       #returns 1
